# Sally

So you finally convinced that bigshot client to go with Statamic for their new website. `YES!` And now you're all excited to build that sexy theme to show of your skills. `OH YES!` So you start a new project in your favourite code editor. `OH GOD YES!` You're ready to do this! You even installed that Antlers Syntax Package to enable code highlighting. `YES YES YES YES!` And as you're about to take care of business, you realize: the client didn't deliver the content and you'll have to fake it ...

Don't worry! *Most developers at one time or another have faked it.* It's perfectly normal. And when it happens: Sally's here to help you out.

You know what they say: fake it 'till you make it!
